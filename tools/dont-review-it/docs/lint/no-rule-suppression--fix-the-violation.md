<!-- BEGIN GENERATED rule-header -->

Disallow taking a rule of the parallel determinism gate out of a run through a suppression comment, a lowered severity, or an ignore entry, leaving the code the rule stands on as the only place a report ends

- Tool: `oxlint`
- Fixable: no
- Suggestions: no
- Options: yes
- Bundle: `governance`
- Source: [`no-rule-suppression--fix-the-violation.ts`](../../src/lint/oxlint/rules/governance/no-rule-suppression--fix-the-violation.ts)

<!-- END GENERATED rule-header -->

## Violation

A rule of the parallel determinism gate taken out of a run. The gate holds the rules that keep one test from starting on the state another left behind, and `targetRules` adds to that list.

Reported: a suppression comment covering one of those rules, in a file the gate reads, whether it covers the file, one line or the end of a range; an entry holding one of them at `off` or `warn`, with or without an override scope; a severity this rule cannot read; a configuration handing suppression comments back their force through `respectEslintDisableDirectives`; and an ignore entry covering an authored spec file.

## Fix

Delete the comment or the entry and rewrite the code the reopened reports stand on. To change the discipline a rule carries, change the rule's definition.

Narrow an ignore pattern to the generated paths it stands for.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED examples -->

Code this rule rejects.

```ts
// grounds written after the separator leave the report standing
// in packages/cart/src/basket.test.ts
// eslint-disable-next-line no-redundant-mock-reset--lift-mocks-into-fixture -- the shared setup lands later
export const total = 1;
```

```ts
// a configuration turning a gate rule off is reported
// in vite.config.ts
export default { lint: { rules: { "dont-review-it/no-redundant-mock-reset--lift-mocks-into-fixture": "off" } } };
```

Code this rule accepts.

```ts
// a suppression naming only a rule outside this gate is another rule's business
// in packages/cart/src/basket.test.ts
/* eslint-disable no-console */
export const total = 1;
```

```ts
// a configuration holding a gate rule at error passes
// in vite.config.ts
export default { lint: { rules: { "dont-review-it/no-redundant-mock-reset--lift-mocks-into-fixture": "error" } } };
```

<!-- END GENERATED examples -->

### Forbidden bypasses (do not do this)

- Lowering the entry to `warn`. A warning takes the rule out of the run all the same
- Writing the severity behind a value assembled elsewhere so the level cannot be read
- Setting `respectEslintDisableDirectives` to `true` to give the comments their force back

## Messages

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED messages -->

| messageId | Text |
| --- | --- |
| `fileScopedSuppression` | A \`{{spelling}}\` comment must not stand over a file this gate reads. It takes {{silenced}} out of the run for every line of the file, and the invariants those rules carry go unchecked here. Delete the comment, then rewrite the code the reopened reports stand on. Rewrite the definition of a rule to change the discipline it carries. |
| `lineScopedSuppression` | A \`{{spelling}}\` comment must not stand in a file this gate reads. It takes {{silenced}} out of the run at the line it covers, and the invariants those rules carry go unchecked there. Delete the comment, then rewrite the code the reopened report stands on. Rewrite the definition of a rule to change the discipline it carries. |
| `suppressionRangeEnd` | A \`{{spelling}}\` comment must not stand in a file this gate reads. It closes a range that takes {{silenced}} out of the run, and the invariants those rules carry go unchecked across that range. Delete both ends of the range, then rewrite the code the reopened reports stand on. Rewrite the definition of a rule to change the discipline it carries. |
| `weakenedRule` | A lint configuration must not hold \`{{ruleName}}\`, a rule of the parallel determinism gate, at \`{{severity}}\`. This entry takes the rule out of every run, and the invariant it carries goes unchecked across the whole tree. Set this entry to \`error\`, then rewrite the code the rule reports. |
| `scopedWeakenedRule` | An override must not hold \`{{ruleName}}\`, a rule of the parallel determinism gate, at \`{{severity}}\` over {{scope}}. Those paths keep the code the rule reports and lose the report itself. Delete this entry, then rewrite the code the rule reports over those paths. |
| `unreadableSeverity` | A severity this rule cannot read must not stand on \`{{ruleName}}\`, a rule of the parallel determinism gate. A value assembled elsewhere hides the level this gate runs at. Write the severity of this entry as the literal \`error\`. |
| `respectedDisableDirectives` | A lint configuration must not hand the suppression comments of a run back their force. Every comment naming a rule of the parallel determinism gate starts taking that rule out of the run again. Set this entry to \`false\`, then delete the comments it was standing for. |
| `ignoredSpecFile` | An ignore entry must not cover a file this gate reads. \`{{pattern}}\` covers \`{{matchedPath}}\`, an authored spec file, and every rule of the gate stops reporting over it. Narrow that pattern to the generated paths it stands for, or delete it and rewrite the code the gate reports. |

## Runtime Selection

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED runtime -->

This rule runs as an oxlint JS plugin, in the same pass as every other rule the workspace ships. It reads options declared on `meta.schema` in the source linked above.
