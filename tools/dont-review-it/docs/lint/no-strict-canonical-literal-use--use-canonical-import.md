# no-strict-canonical-literal-use--use-canonical-import

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED rule-header -->

Disallow writing a value that a declared vocabulary already owns as a literal, so every use site derives its spelling from the one place that declares it

- Tool: `oxlint`
- Fixable: no
- Suggestions: no
- Options: yes
- Bundle: `single-ownership`
- Source: [`no-strict-canonical-literal-use--use-canonical-import.ts`](../../src/lint/oxlint/rules/single-ownership/no-strict-canonical-literal-use--use-canonical-import.ts)

<!-- END GENERATED rule-header -->

## Violation

A literal in a production source spelling a value that a declared vocabulary already owns. The catalog of owners is built from the `@canonical-values` declarations across the repository, and the report names the concepts that own the value.

Verification files and anything outside the production scope are not read.

## Fix

Import the binding the owner publishes and use that in place of the literal.

Where the value belongs to a concept nobody owns yet, register the vocabulary in the module that owns it.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED examples -->

Code this rule rejects.

```ts
// a catalog value spelled at the site of use is reported
const value = "draft";
```

```ts
// keys that describe a new set are each reported
type StatusMap = Record<"draft" | "published", boolean>;
```

Code this rule accepts.

```ts
// a value the catalog does not carry is spelled where it is used
const value = "unlisted";
```

```ts
// selecting from an existing structure is not describing a new set
type Draft = Pick<Model, "draft">;
```

<!-- END GENERATED examples -->

### Forbidden bypasses (do not do this)

- Assembling the literal from parts so it no longer matches. The use site still carries its own spelling
- Declaring a local constant holding the same literal. The spelling is still decided here

This rule runs as an oxlint JS plugin, in the same pass as every other rule the workspace ships. It reads options declared on `meta.schema` in the source linked above.
