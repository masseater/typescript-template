# no-undersized-external-snapshot--use-inline-snapshot

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED rule-header -->

Disallow an external snapshot whose recorded value fits within the shared inline budget, so where a recorded value lives follows from its size rather than from the taste of whoever wrote the assertion

- Tool: `oxlint`
- Fixable: yes
- Suggestions: no
- Options: yes
- Bundle: `testing`
- Source: [`no-undersized-external-snapshot--use-inline-snapshot.ts`](../../src/lint/oxlint/rules/testing/no-undersized-external-snapshot--use-inline-snapshot.ts)

<!-- END GENERATED rule-header -->

## Violation

A snapshot recorded in a file when the record is short enough to stand in the spec. The recorded text is looked up in `__snapshots__/<spec file name>.snap` by the entry key the matcher answers to, and where it holds fewer lines than the limit the assertion is reported.

Entry keys are built from the chain of block titles and a number per key; inline records consume the same numbers, so they are counted. Where a title settles only at run time, or a loop or a branch leaves the call order unsettled, no entry is looked up and the rule stays quiet.

An automatic fix replaces the matcher with its inline spelling and drops the hint argument.

## Fix

Take the record into the spec with the inline matcher, so the expected value stands beside the claim it belongs to.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED examples -->

Code this rule rejects.

```ts
// a record inside the budget is reported and moved to an inline record
describe("outer", () => {
  it("names a behaviour", () => {
    expect(subject).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

```ts
// an inline record ahead of it shifts which entry the call is measured against
describe("outer", () => {
  it("names a behaviour", () => {
    expect(first).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`"first"`);
    expect(subject).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

Code this rule accepts.

```ts
// a record past the budget is already in the right place
describe("outer", () => {
  it("names a behaviour", () => {
    expect(subject).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

```ts
// an inline record is the other rule's subject
describe("outer", () => {
  it("names a behaviour", () => {
    expect(subject).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`"alpha"`);
  });
});
```

### Forbidden bypasses (do not do this)

- Padding the recorded value so it passes the limit. What is pinned has not changed
- Settling the block title at run time so no entry can be looked up

| messageId | Text |
| --- | --- |
| `undersizedExternalSnapshot` | A recorded value of {{recordedLines}} lines must not sit in an external snapshot file against a shared budget of {{maxLines}} lines for a value that belongs beside its assertion. Replace \`{{matcher}}\` with \`{{inlineSpelling}}\`, drop any snapshot hint, and rerun the suite with snapshot updating turned on to carry the value at \`{{key}}\` into this spec. |
| `undersizedTableDrivenSnapshot` | A recorded value of {{recordedLines}} lines must not sit in an external snapshot file against a shared budget of {{maxLines}} lines for a value that belongs beside its assertion. Split this table-driven declaration into one test block per case, replace \`{{matcher}}\` with \`{{inlineSpelling}}\` in each block, and rerun the suite with snapshot updating turned on to carry the values at \`{{key}}\` into this spec. |
| `unresolvableExternalSnapshot` | An external snapshot must not be recorded under a key that cannot be spelled out from this spec alone. Write every enclosing title as a literal string, write the snapshot hint as a literal string, and lift this call out of the loop, branch or nested callback that hides its position among the recorded values. |

## Runtime Selection

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED runtime -->

This rule runs as an oxlint JS plugin, in the same pass as every other rule the workspace ships. It reads options declared on `meta.schema` in the source linked above.
