<!-- BEGIN GENERATED rule-header -->

Require the test config to demand full coverage on every metric, so the amount of untested code that is allowed to stay is a decision written down once rather than whatever the suite happens to reach

- Tool: `oxlint`
- Fixable: no
- Suggestions: no
- Options: yes
- Bundle: `testing`
- Source: [`no-lenient-coverage-threshold--demand-full-coverage.ts`](../../src/lint/oxlint/rules/testing/no-lenient-coverage-threshold--demand-full-coverage.ts)

## Violation

A test runner configuration whose coverage floor is absent or falls short. Only `vite.config` and `vitest.config` files are read; the default-exported expression is entered, through a wrapping call such as `defineConfig({ ... })`, then `test`, `coverage` and `thresholds` in turn.

Four reports. `thresholds` not being reachable at all is one. A metric carrying no numeric literal there is another, whether the property is absent or its value is a reference, a spread or a computed expression. A numeric literal below what is demanded is the third. `perFile` not set to `true` is the fourth, and it is independent of the others.

`branches`, `functions`, `lines` and `statements` each default to a demand of 100 and can be lowered one at a time. The shorthand `thresholds: { 100: true }` satisfies all four, and where a key is written twice the later one is read.

## Fix

Write `test.coverage.thresholds` with the demanded number on all four metrics and `perFile: true`. Where 100 everywhere is right, `thresholds: { 100: true, perFile: true }` says the same thing.

Where the measured value falls short, cover the code. An unreachable branch is a branch to delete.

Code this rule rejects.

```ts
// a full threshold checked against the package total is reported
// in vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite-plus";
export default defineConfig({ test: { coverage: { thresholds: { branches: 100, functions: 100, lines: 100, statements: 100 } } } });

```

```ts
// a metric left out is reported on its own
// in vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite-plus";
export default defineConfig({ test: { coverage: { thresholds: { functions: 100, lines: 100, statements: 100, perFile: true } } } });

```

Code this rule accepts.

```ts
// every metric spelled out at full coverage, checked file by file, passes
// in vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite-plus";
export default defineConfig({ test: { coverage: { thresholds: { branches: 100, functions: 100, lines: 100, statements: 100, perFile: true } } } });

```

```ts
// the shorthand that demands full coverage on every metric at once passes
// in vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite-plus";
export default defineConfig({ test: { coverage: { thresholds: { 100: true, perFile: true } } } });

```

### Forbidden bypasses (do not do this)

- Deleting the `test` block. The same report stands for having no `thresholds`
- Adding the files that fall short to `coverage.exclude`. They leave the denominator and nothing is covered
- Escaping the numbers into constants in another file. The floor stops being readable here and counts as undeclared
- Removing `perFile` to pass on the package total
