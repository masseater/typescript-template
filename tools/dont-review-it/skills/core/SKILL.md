  Adopt @repo/dont-review-it in a Vite+ repository: call `dontReviewItPreset.fmt()` and `dontReviewItPreset.lint()` inside the `fmt` and `lint` blocks of `vite.config.ts`. The preset rejects `function` declarations, `export default`, `interface`, truthiness tests, type assertions, reassignment and in-place mutation, `.then` chains, `console`, explanatory comments, `beforeEach`, and every form of rule suppression, and caps `max-params` at 2 and `max-statements` at 10. Extend `@repo/dont-review-it/tsconfig/app.json` or `library.json` from every tsconfig, capture process output with `standardIoTest` from `@repo/dont-review-it/vitest`, and prove a custom rule is wired with a violating probe file. Load when configuring oxlint or oxfmt with this preset, when a `dont-review-it/*` rule reports, when you need to know what the preset actually rejects, or when `ignorePatterns` or `lint.plugins` seem to have no effect.

# @repo/dont-review-it — adopt the preset

The preset holds machine-enforced answers to writing questions that would otherwise be raised in code review. Only questions with one answer are in it; anything whose answer depends on the situation is left to a human. Every rule ships at error severity, every report names a unique fix, and the matching file under `docs/lint/` carries the reasoning the message deliberately leaves out.

## requires

- **Vite+, with the toolchain configuration consolidated in `vite.config.ts`.** The package declares `vite-plus` as a peer dependency and both preset functions return the object a Vite+ block owns. There is no path that applies this preset from `.oxlintrc.json` — a repository that keeps its oxlint configuration in a separate file cannot adopt it without moving that configuration first.

## Setup

In the repository root `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
import { dontReviewItPreset } from "@repo/dont-review-it";
import { defineConfig } from "vite-plus";

export default defineConfig({
  fmt: dontReviewItPreset.fmt(),
  lint: dontReviewItPreset.lint(),
});
```

Each function returns the whole object its block must own: the patterns git is told to ignore, and — for `lint` — the rule sets of `@repo/dont-review-it/lint-rule-authoring` and `@repo/dont-review-it` together with the JS plugin that holds the custom rules, or — for `fmt` — the formatting choices this repository fixes. Whatever you pass in layers on top: `lint({ rules: { ... } })` keeps your rules, and an `extends` you pass lands after the shipped presets.

The preset also keeps oxlint's default plugin set and turns `reportUnusedDisableDirectives` into an error, so a suppression comment that has stopped matching anything fails the lint instead of quietly persisting.

## What adopting it changes about the code you write

The rule list is discoverable — `vp lint --print-config` prints every built-in rule the preset resolves. What that output does not tell you is which ordinary-looking code stops compiling, so start here.

**A module exports named arrow constants.** `func-style` is `expression` and `no-default-export--use-named-export` is on, so `function parse() {}` and `export default` are both rejected. Write `export const parse = () => {}`.

**A function takes at most two parameters.** `max-params` is 2, and most functions in this preset's own source therefore take one destructured object. Adding a third parameter is a rewrite, not a tweak — decide the shape before you write the signature.

**A type is a `type`, never an `interface`.** `no-interface-declaration--write-a-type-alias` leaves an `interface` only inside `declare module`, `declare global` or `declare namespace`, where it has to merge into a declaration someone else owns.

**Truthiness is not a test.** `strict-boolean-expressions` rejects `if (name)` on a string and `if (count)` on a number. Compare: `if (name !== "")`.

**Values are parsed, not asserted.** `no-explicit-any`, the whole `no-unsafe-*` family, `no-non-null-assertion`, and the custom `no-unchecked-cast--parse-at-boundary` and `no-double-type-assertion--declare-the-real-type` leave no way to force a type through. Unknown input is parsed at the boundary or it does not enter.

**Nothing is reassigned or mutated in place.** `prefer-const`, `no-var`, and the custom `no-reassign--use-spread-or-iife`, `no-array-mutation--derive-new-array`, and `no-receiver-mutation--derive-new-value` mean a changed value appears as a new binding.

**Promises are awaited.** `no-floating-promises` and the custom `no-promise-chain--use-async-await` reject both a dropped promise and a `.then` chain.

**Output does not go through `console`.** `no-console` is on; a CLI writes to `process.stdout` and `process.stderr` directly.

**Code carries no explanatory comments.** `no-explanatory-comment--delete-or-move-to-commit-message` sends the reasoning to the commit message.

**Tests have no hooks and one assertion each.** `vitest/no-hooks` and `forbid-test-hook--move-setup-into-fixture` reject `beforeEach`; setup arrives through a `test.extend` fixture. `forbid-multi-expect-it--split-into-separate-it` caps assertions per block, and `no-lenient-coverage-threshold--demand-full-coverage` rejects a coverage threshold below full.

**A rule cannot be silenced.** `respectEslintDisableDirectives` is `false`, so an `eslint-disable` comment is inert here; `reportUnusedDisableDirectives` is an error; and `no-rule-suppression--fix-the-violation` and `no-blanket-suppression--name-and-record` close what remains.

**Size limits reject working code.** `complexity` 10, `max-depth` 4, `max-statements` 10, `max-nested-callbacks` 2, `max-classes-per-file` 1, and `max-lines-per-function` 200 in source files. Under `specs/`, `describe` nesting is capped at 1.

Every rule the preset adds beyond the upstream sets — 104 of them, the ones `--print-config` never lists — is in [references/lint-rules.md](references/lint-rules.md) with what it rejects and a link to its document. That file is generated from the rule implementations, so it cannot fall behind them.

Each report ends with the rule document's path, relative to this package's repository. From an installed copy, read it at `https://github.com/masseater/mst/blob/main/<path>`; the reference table already links every rule there.

## Core Patterns

### Extend a shared tsconfig preset

```json
{
  "extends": "@repo/dont-review-it/tsconfig/library.json",
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

`library.json` for published packages, `app.json` for application workspaces. A tsconfig written from scratch is reported by `no-standalone-tsconfig--extend-shared-preset`.

### Prove a custom rule actually fires

```sh
echo "export default {}" > src/wiring-probe.ts
vp lint src/wiring-probe.ts
rm src/wiring-probe.ts
```

The run must report `dont-review-it/no-default-export--use-named-export`. A green lint over the probe means the JS plugin is not wired — there is no other signal, because an unwired plugin produces no error, no warning, and no diagnostic of its own.

### Capture process output in a test instead of building a double

```ts
import { standardIoTest } from "@repo/dont-review-it/vitest";
import { expect } from "vite-plus/test";

standardIoTest("writes the usage line to stderr", ({ stderr }) => {
  runCli(["--unknown"]);
  expect(stderr.text()).toContain("Usage:");
});
```

`stdout` and `stderr` are auto-applied fixtures holding the captured chunks and a `text()` join. Both are restored after the test.

### Respond to a report

Each message states the prohibition and the imperative fix, and ends with the repository-relative path of the rule's document. Apply the fix the message names; open the document when you need the reasoning. Do not add a disable directive — an unused one is itself an error, and the suppression question was already answered by writing the rule.

## Common Mistakes

### [HIGH] ignorePatterns placed in an extended preset

Wrong:

```ts
export const myPreset = defineConfig({
  extends: [somePreset],
  ignorePatterns: [".agents/"],
});
```

Correct:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  lint: dontReviewItPreset.lint({
    ignorePatterns: [".agents/"],
  }),
});
```

oxlint's config merge keeps only the extending side's `ignorePatterns` and drops the ones an `extends` target ships, without an error or a warning — so the preset function must produce the object handed to `defineConfig` itself. `no-unwrapped-toolchain-config--call-the-preset-for-the-block` reports a config that forgets to call it.

### [HIGH] lint.plugins written as an addition

Wrong:

```ts
lint: dontReviewItPreset.lint({
  plugins: ["vitest"],
}),
```

Correct:

```ts
lint: dontReviewItPreset.lint({
  plugins: ["unicorn", "typescript", "oxc", "vitest"],
}),
```

`plugins` replaces the base plugin set rather than extending it, so naming one plugin silently switches off the default `unicorn`, `typescript`, and `oxc` rules — dozens of them — while the lint goes on passing and the diff shows one added line.

Source: masseater/mst:.claude/rules/ai-generated/gotchas.md

### [HIGH] a print-config diff read as proof of JS plugin wiring

Wrong:

```sh
vp lint --print-config
```

Correct:

```sh
echo "export default {}" > src/wiring-probe.ts
vp lint src/wiring-probe.ts
rm src/wiring-probe.ts
```

`--print-config` resolves built-in rules only; it never lists a rule that arrives through a `jsPlugins` entry or an extended preset, so adding one produces an empty diff and the check confirms nothing it was meant to confirm.

Source: masseater/mst:.claude/rules/ai-generated/gotchas.md

### [HIGH] a GitHub alert written with its body on the next line

Wrong:

```md
> [!IMPORTANT] Install through the official installer.
```

Correct:

```md
> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Install through the official installer.
```

`fmt` sets `proseWrap: "never"`, so a blockquote whose marker and body form one paragraph is joined into a single line, which GitHub renders as an ordinary blockquote with `[!IMPORTANT]` as literal text. A `>`-only line makes the marker its own paragraph, which survives the join.

### [MEDIUM] a tsconfig written from scratch

Wrong:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "target": "esnext"
  }
}
```

Correct:

```json
{
  "extends": "@repo/dont-review-it/tsconfig/library.json",
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

A standalone tsconfig drifts from the shared compiler options one release at a time, and nothing compares the two — the workspace keeps type-checking, against weaker settings than everything around it.

Source: masseater/mst:tools/dont-review-it/docs/lint/no-standalone-tsconfig--extend-shared-preset.md

### [MEDIUM] a second exported config added beside the preset

Wrong:

```ts
export const dontReviewItStrictPreset = { lint: () => ({ ... }) };
```

Correct:

```ts
export const dontReviewItPreset = { fmt, lint };
```

One rule set applies at the root and reaches the whole repository; a second entry point makes the reach depend on which one a repository wired, which puts the adoption decision back where the preset exists to remove it.

## Reference

```
@repo/dont-review-it                    dontReviewItPreset { fmt, lint }
@repo/dont-review-it/plugin             the oxlint jsPlugins entry (registered by the preset)
@repo/dont-review-it/vitest             standardIoTest, CapturedStream
@repo/dont-review-it/tsconfig/app.json      application workspaces
@repo/dont-review-it/tsconfig/library.json  published packages
dont-review-it check                   the repository-wide checks (see the sibling skill)
```

`specs/` is the one place the rule set narrows itself: an override there switches the required spelling to `.spec.ts`, drops the source-adjacency requirement, and caps `describe` nesting.
