# @repo/ai-native

What each published version changes for the packages that install it, and for the agents that load the skills shipped beside this file.

## 0.0.0

- `throttle` caps how many wrapped commands run at once per host and namespace, reclaims slots held by processes that died, and can kill a command's whole process group on a timeout. Preparing the slots discards anything left at a lock's path that is not the directory the lock library creates, so a slot directory polluted by something else does not block every later run.
- `spool` diverts a child's merged output into a log file under `.spool/` and prints a fixed-size summary in its place, passing the child's exit code through. In CI it streams the output instead and writes no file.
- `unabridged`, a Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook that denies a Bash call when `head` or `tail` stands at a command position of the command line, and says nothing otherwise.
- `sync-base`, a Claude Code `SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit` / `Stop` hook that, when the current branch has an open pull request whose `mergeStateStatus` is `BEHIND`, injects an `additionalContext` instruction to bring the latest base into the head, and says nothing otherwise.
- `@repo/ai-native/telemetry`, the one place a process starts its OpenTelemetry provider. The first caller fixes `service.name`, `MST_TELEMETRY` turns measurement on, `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` turns it back off, and shutdown runs after every other `beforeExit` handler.
- `@repo/ai-native/vitest-sdk`, the entry Vitest's `experimental.openTelemetry.sdkPath` is pointed at.
