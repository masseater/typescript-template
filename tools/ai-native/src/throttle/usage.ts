const USAGE = `Usage: throttle [--timeout <seconds>] -- <command> [args...]

Runs the command while keeping the number of simultaneous executions that
share this host and namespace at or below the limit. When every slot is held
the wrapper joins a wait queue, reports its position on stderr, and retries
every slot on each poll, for at most the wait budget. The operating system
releases a slot when its holder exits, including an abrupt termination. Do
not nest throttle inside a command it wraps: the inner call counts
as one more competitor and consumes a second slot.

Options:
  --timeout <seconds>  Stop the command's whole process tree after this many
                       seconds. POSIX sends SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after a short
                       grace period; Windows uses taskkill /T /F immediately.
                       0 never interrupts the command. Defaults to 0.

Environment:
  MST_THROTTLE_LIMIT   Number of slots shared by every throttle on this host
                       and namespace. Invalid values (non-integer, zero or
                       less) fall back to the default of 1.

Exit codes:
  0  the wrapped command succeeded
  1  the wrapped command failed, was killed, could not be started, ran past
     the timeout, or the wrapper could not get or release a slot
  2  throttle itself was called incorrectly`;
